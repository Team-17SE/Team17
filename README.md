Team 17's respiratory for Fall2023 SE project 
To run our game, have all the Java files and txt files in the same Directory. Compile each java file and then run Test.java. When inserting new players, be sure to use the format "ID/FName/LName/CodeName". Also the professor said I can use flat files, so keep this in mind. Press F1 to add new players. It will initially bring up a window to add a player to the green team, press f2 if you want to add to red team; if you want to go back to the green team add window, press f2 again.
krhernan0101 is Kevin Hernandez. The professor has instructed me not to use sockets for this project. To setup interactions between players, a JFrame titled "Interactions" will appear for you to manually enter an interaction. Format this as "player-tagging:player-Tagged" with player-tagging and player-Tagged being equipment ids of any players. Also please keep in mind to insert players onto the red team, press f1 at the player entry screen and when prompted to insert players on the green team, press f2 to insert on the red team. Let the games begin!
