# Team17
Team 17's respiratory for Fall2023 SE project.
To run this game, have all the Java files and text files in the same Directory.
Compile each java file and then run Test.java. When inserting new players, be sure to use the format
"ID/FName/LName/CodeName". The professorhas states that since I couldn't get the database or the sockets working
that I could use flat files to store the player's info and their respective equipment id's. At the player
entry screen, press F1 to add new players. It'll initially prompt you to insert info for the green team, to 
add to the red team press f2 and to return to the green team prompt press f2 again. Since the sockets 
could not be sucessfully implemented, the professor has allowed me to have a window during play for the user
to add interactions between the players. This will be formatted as "player-transmitting:player-tagged". 
For both player-transmitting and player-tagged, use their respective equipment id's; the professor said
I can store them into their own text files. Also a reminder, to add to the red team press f2 when prompted to add to the green team.
Happy playing!
